# Introduction

scrabblescrabble is a mock "Scrabble" game played on a 15 x 15 grid.  Each of the 1-4 players has a tray with 7 letters drawn from a bag of pre-set letters.  On each turn the player places a valid word on the game board.  Points are awarded based on the words placed, determined by the score of each letter used.  This first iteration of scrabblescrabble accepts user input from the keyboard.
